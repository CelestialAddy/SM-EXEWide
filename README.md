# SM-EXEWide
A simple Python program that changes a "Spider-Man" (2002/Windows) executable so that the game renders in 16:9,
according to the information available at [WSGF](https://www.wsgf.org/dr/spider-man-movie). Probably doesn't work for every
game executable version. Back up your EXE first, in every case.

## Usage
It's a console program. Run it and you'll be asked to enter the path to your game EXE. Do so, press ENTER, and the program
will inform you of error or success and then quit. Your EXE is overwritten with the new version in the event of success.
